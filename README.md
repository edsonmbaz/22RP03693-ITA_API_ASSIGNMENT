Introduction
This project involves the development of APIs to handle different data entities such as student records, product management, and category organization for an online store. The implementation utilizes PHP and Laravel frameworks to ensure efficient data handling and structured API responses. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the tasks and the required steps to build the necessary features.

Task 1: Student Information Representation (XML and JSON)
Data Structure Creation
Develop an XML file and a JSON object to represent a student's information, including:

Name
Age
Gender
A list of enrolled subjects, where each subject contains:
Subject Name
Grade
XQuery Operations
Implement XQuery expressions to:

Retrieve the student’s name and age.
Fetch the names of subjects the student is enrolled in.
Task 2: Product Management API (PHP)
API Functionalities
Develop the following endpoints to manage product records:

GET /products - Retrieve a list of all products.
GET /products/{id} - Fetch details of a specific product by its ID.
POST /products - Add a new product.
PUT /products/{id} - Update product details by ID.
DELETE /products/{id} - Remove a product from the list.
Product Data Structure
Each product should contain the following attributes:

ID
Name
Description
Price
Data will be stored in an in-memory PHP array for simplicity, and all API responses should be formatted in JSON.

Task 3: Online Store Category Management API (Laravel)
Database Configuration
Create a MySQL database named "online_store" and set up a categories table with the following columns:

id
name
lft
rgt
created_at
updated_at
Implementing Nested Set Model
Utilize Laravel’s Eloquent ORM to manage hierarchical category structures using the Nested Set Model.

API Endpoints for Categories
GET /categories - Fetch all categories in XML format.
GET /categories/{id} - Retrieve a category by ID in XML format.
POST /categories - Add a new category (accept XML with name and parent_id).
PUT /categories/{id} - Modify an existing category (accept XML with name).
DELETE /categories/{id} - Remove a category and return a success message in XML format.
Validation & Error Handling
Ensure proper validation and return well-structured XML error messages for invalid requests. The API should be implemented using Laravel routes, controllers, and models.

Unit Testing
Develop unit tests to verify the correctness of each API endpoint.

Task 4: Banking System API (Laravel)
